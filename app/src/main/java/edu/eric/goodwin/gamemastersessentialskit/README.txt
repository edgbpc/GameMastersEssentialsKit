Activity - 1, main
Fragment - 2, menu screen, dice roller screen
Drawables - 1, logo
Fragment/Screen layout.xml file - 4(3), activity_main, dice_list_layout, fragment_dice_roller, initial_screen
Animations - ? maybe, button flash?
SQLite - 2, 1 table ( i feel this should be worth a lot more.  the persistence layer alone is quite a bit of work)
Data structure/class ??? (i have DiceRolls data class but technically each view fragment is a class and the dice roller
    adapter is a class, and so is MainActivity) so like 5(3)????
Interface/abstract classes - 2, menuscreen and diceroller are both supported by listeners
RecyclerView, Holder, and Adapter - 3
